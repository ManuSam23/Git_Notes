Step 2 
 Performing clone operation in cmd
 The repository link  https://github.com/ManuSam23 /lara.git

Meanwhile, in our git repository folder
New repository lara folder will be created.

Add any text/word document and save.
In local system whatever repository is there we need do three main things…
By using command prompt
1.	Adding  
2.	Committing

GitHub 			(Day 2)	20/09/2023 Wed

Git is a software we need to install it.
https://git-scm.com/downloads 
Let’s us consider
In a project multiple developers involving in the project
Person A developing lara1.java
Person B developing lara2.java
These classes code should be accessible by all the other project developers.
In other words,
Let’s take customer module and product module are two repositories…
Customer code should be accessible by remaining developers and also product module code should be accessible by all the remaining project developers.
For this purpose, it is very much recommended to have centralized repository.
Authentication is very much required…
For this sign up is required
User name && password and mail-id is recommended…

In local system whatever repository is there we need do three main things…
By using command prompt
4.	Adding  (git add –all)
5.	Committing  (git commit -m “Testing”)
6.	Pushing  (git push origin main)

Steps to be followed before Authentication
1.	Go to existing GitHub account 
2.	Sign out 


Steps to be followed during Authentication
1.	Go to control panel
2.	User Accounts
3.	Credential Manager
4.	Windows credential
5.	git: https://github.com  
6.	Remove
7.	Yes 

Steps to be followed for Authentication
Open new command prompt from new repository folder (Alt+ d) type (cmd)
Try performing push operation
	git push origin main
Now it will ask authentication sign up with your GitHub account.
Note: We can also try this by taking two/ three GitHub accounts.
